School project using arduino. The ballon is 6" long, which we have
fitted with a housing underneath containing an arduino, a digital
compass and four ultrasound sensors for collision detection.

Two propellors are fitted on a crossbeam controlled by a servo. An
additionol propeller is fitted on the tail of the blimp.

The control system includes two PIDs used to stabilize height and
course.
